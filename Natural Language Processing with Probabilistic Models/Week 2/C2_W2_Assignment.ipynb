    "# Assignment 2: Parts-of-Speech Tagging (POS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second assignment of Course 2 in the Natural Language Processing specialization. This assignment will develop skills in part-of-speech (POS) tagging, the process of assigning a part-of-speech tag (Noun, Verb, Adjective...) to each word in an input text.  Tagging is difficult because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times. They are  **Ambiguous**. Let's look at the following example: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The whole team played **well**. [adverb]\n",
    "- You are doing **well** for yourself. [adjective]\n",
    "- **Well**, this assignment took me forever to complete. [interjection]\n",
    "- The **well** is dry. [noun]\n",
    "- Tears were beginning to **well** in her eyes. [verb]\n",
    "\n",
    "Often distinguishing the parts-of-speech of a word in a sentence will help you better understand the meaning of a sentence. This would be critically important in search queries. Identifying the proper noun, the organization, the stock symbol, or anything similar would greatly improve everything ranging from speech recognition to search. By completing this assignment, you will: \n",

    "- Compute the Viterbi algorithm \n",

    "This assignment will use two tagged data sets collected from the Wall Street Journal(WSJ). [Here](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pages/mbsp-tags) is an example 'tag-set' or Part of Speech designation describing the two or three letter tag and their meaning. One data set (WSJ-2_21.pos) will be used for training, the other (WSJ-24.pos) for test. The tagged training data has been preprocessed to form a vocabulary (hmm_vocab.txt). The words in the vocabulary are words from the training set that were used two or more times. The vocabulary is augmented with a set of 'unknown word tokens', described below. The training set will be used to create the emission, transmission and tag counts. \n",
    "The test set (WSJ-24.pos) is read in to create 'y'. This contains both the test text and the true tag. The test set has also been preprocessed to remove the tags to form 'test_words.txt'. This is read in and further processed to identify the end of sentences and handle words not in the vocabulary using functions provided in utils_pos.py. This forms the list 'prep', the preprocessed text used to test our  POS taggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A POS tagger will necessarily encounter words that are not in its datasets. To improve accuracy, these words are further analyzed during preprocessing to extract available hints as to their appropriate tag. For example, the suffix 'ize' is a hint that the word is a verb, as in 'final-ize' or 'character-ize'. A set of unknown-tokens, such as '--unk-verb--' or '--unk-noun--' will replace the unknown words in both the training and test corpus and will appear in the emission, transmission and tag data structures.\n",

For example, to compute the probability that the tag of 'tracks' is verb, 3rd person singular present (VBZ), highlighed in orange below, it will examine each of the paths from the tags of 'Loss' and choose the most likely.  An example of the calculation for **one** of those paths is the path from (\"Loss\", NN). The log of the probability of the path to and including 'Loss\" being a noun (NN) is -14.32. We add to that the log of the probability of NN transitioning to VBS from the A matrix, circled in the diagram, log(4.37e-02). To that we add the log of the probability that the tag VBS would have an 'emission' 'tracks', log(4.61e-4) for a total of -25.13. This will turn out to the the most likely, but all other paths from 'Loss' are examined as well. The most likely path is stored in the best_path table - shown in orange. \n",

Some implementations use bidirectional tagging, meaning knowing the previous word and the next word would tell you more about the POS instead of just knowing the previous word. But of course, if you can implement this unidirectional approach, it lays the foundation to other POS taggers used in industry, (which are just a little bit more complicated than what you have just implemented). This assignment is critical to understanding other POS tagging methods. With this implementation you managed to get 95% accuracy.
